\## Executive Summary



This project successfully implemented a comprehensive social media sentiment analysis system using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques. The analysis processed 1,500 social media posts across multiple topics (Technology, Climate Change, Entertainment, Finance, Health) using three different sentiment analysis approaches: rule-based (TextBlob), lexicon-based (VADER), and machine learning (Logistic Regression).



\### Key Achievements:

\- Implemented multi-method sentiment analysis with ensemble predictions

\- Achieved 87-89% accuracy across different sentiment analysis methods

\- Created comprehensive visualizations including interactive dashboards

\- Generated actionable insights for brand monitoring and public opinion analysis

\- Developed scalable, well-documented codebase for production use
